In order to build profiler you must have DIA SDK available in include/library paths. I have set mine to {{{"$(VSInstallDir)DIA SDK\include"}}} and {{{"$(VSInstallDir)DIA SDK\lib"}}} correspondingly.
You may build sources using VisualStudio 2008 SP1+ or 2010. Profiler core (micro-profiler.dll) is being developed using TDD, so you may run its tests, by selecting *micro-profiler.tests* project as startup and running it. VisualStudio integrated testing framework is used.
